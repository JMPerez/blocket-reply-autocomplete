Blocket reply autocomplete
==========================
A Google Chrome Extension that autocompletes the fields when replying to an add.

## Why
If you have used Blocket for doing an active search, like looking for an apartment, you know you need to reply to lots of ads. Yet you also want each message to be slightly customised.

## Setting up
This is a content script extension, which means you don't need to click on any button to control it. Open the Options page for the extension and input the name, email, phone number and message text. You can use placeholders in your message that will be replaced with data from the ad. The available placeholders are:
* advertiser_short_name
* ad_id

## How it works
Go to a page on Blocket and click on "Mejla annons√∂ren". The reply form will be autocompleted. You can review and modify the text before submitting it.
